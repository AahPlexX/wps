# Active tasks

Task statuses use the values defined in `docs/TRACKER.md`.

## Resume here

Current state: production migration, strict TypeScript integration, dependency lock, GitHub Pages enablement, deployment, live responsive/interaction checks, and evidence reconciliation are complete.  
Next action: future work starts by reading `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/TRACKER.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md`; verify political-source freshness before data changes.  
Blockers: none.
